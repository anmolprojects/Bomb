# Bomb Placement Simulation in Java

This project is a Java console-based program that simulates placing a bomb on a
grid representing land and water.

## Program Description
The program first takes the number of rows and columns to create a 2D grid.
Each cell in the grid represents either **land** or **water**, entered by the user.

After the grid is created, the user provides the **row and column position**
where a bomb is placed. The bomb location is then marked in the grid using
a special symbol (`#`), and the updated grid is displayed.

## Key Features
- Dynamic creation of a 2D array using user input
- Input of land and water values for each cell
- User-defined bomb position
- Conversion of user input into zero-based indexing
- Display of the original grid with bomb placement

## Technologies Used
- Java
- 2D Arrays
- Scanner class for input handling

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the file in a Java-supported IDE or terminal
3. Compile the program:javac bomb.java
4. Run the program:java bomb
   
## Purpose
This program was developed to practice:
- Working with two-dimensional arrays
- Handling user input
- Applying array indexing logic
- Basic grid-based problem solving in Java
